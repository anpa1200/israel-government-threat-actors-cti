# TEMPLELOCK

This is a defensive tool-intelligence page. It is intended for analyst navigation, source review, and hunt planning. It is not a malware-analysis report and does not contain sample code or binaries.

## Summary

- Associated actor: [UNC1860](../actors/unc1860.md)
- Tool type: Defense-evasion utility
- Confidence: High
- Source: [`SRC-MANDIANT-UNC1860`](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1860-iran-middle-eastern-networks)
- Source title: Google Cloud / Mandiant, UNC1860 and the Temple of Oats: Iran's Hidden Hand in Middle Eastern Networks, 2024-09-19

## Behavior

Mandiant reports TEMPLELOCK as a .NET utility observed in foothold utilities and passive implants, capable of terminating threats associated with Windows Event Log service and restarting service operation on demand.

## Hash And IOC Status

- Status: Hash not committed; use Mandiant activity-level IOC list.
- Reference: `SRC-MANDIANT-UNC1860`

Hashes and IOCs on this page are source pointers or representative public indicators. They SHOULD be refreshed from the linked source before operational use and MUST NOT be used alone for actor attribution.

## Defensive Hunting Notes

Hunt Event Log service stop/start anomalies, log service tampering, and unusual .NET utility execution from compromised servers.

## Handling Notes

Treat as behavior trigger, not attribution by itself.

## Related Actor-Level Repository Detections

These detections are mapped through the associated actor or scenario and are not automatically tool-specific. Promote a tool-specific detection only after the behavior is tied to telemetry and test evidence.
